# F21_JP_Titan-Sims
 
TO-DO LIST:

To-do in code:

-add initial eccentricity and div factor as command-line args??
-if same output file exists, delete it

-Check values of k2 for Saturn and Titan

To-do in writing:

-redo tctl implementation paper citation?
-citations for other implementation papers
-read Cuk about Mimas limit on Q
-Describe what is Q--see email
-redo intro/make sure not plagiarizing adviser


QUESTIONS FOR ADVISER:

Questions about Code:

-Eccentricity oscillations:
    -How to set obliquity of Saturn when adding Jupiter if heliocentric
    -Try artificial eccentricity oscillations?
-Titan's tides correct? What does a time lag mean for something that is tidally locked?
-Use different equatorial radius for Saturn? vs avrg radius
-Run with different timescales?
-Run with different initial eccentricities?
-try with 0 initial eccentricity?
-how is what Iâ€™m doing different from Cuk?

Questions about Writing:

-What is the actual time-lag parameter?
-What is Q?
-Honor Code?
-include adviser in header?
-Should I include the exponential migration simulations and explain that too in numerical methods?
-introduction
